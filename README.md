Nightwriter is a translation script that allows users to translate from Braille to English and from English to Braille.

I really enjoyed extending my capabilities with OOD by creating Line Objects, that were composed of Braille Character Objects, composed of Dot objects in order to create a OOP solution for the English to Braille translation.
