They know they have to work hard to get ahead - and they want to. In the following century, men and women of faith waded into the battles over prison reform and temperance, public education and women's rights - and above all, abolition. We cannot ignore that we have a right and a duty to protect our borders. Now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education, because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy. And it is my first duty as President to protect the American people. I have made it clear to the Iraqi people that we pursue no bases, and no claim on their territory or resources.

Thank you, and God bless America.
